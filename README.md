## Overview
### Description
Video app for users to post their opinions through a video or audio recording, regarding various topics. Users within the community can interact by leaving their responses only through video or audio. No text comments will be implemented in the app as the theme is to promote authentic engagement.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social News / Video
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile.
- **Story:** Allow users to post video/audio recordings of their opinions regarding a related topic. Users will be able to browse for questions and discussions happening within the community and leave a response through video/audio recordings.
- **Market:** The market that the app is looking to capture is an authentic and thoughtful community of users.
- **Habit:** The special element of this app is that there is NO text comment for that type of engagement. This app forces a community of engaging through thoughtful video or audio responses. Being that this app doesn't allow for text comments, it will force users to dedicate the time to leave meaningful responses and it will filter out the noisy comments.
- **Scope:** We will connect the app with daily headlines in the news and post them for discussion in the community. Once users leave their opinions, other users can rate them by "likes" as the top will be pushed to the top of the discussion.
